## What is not under the GPL

- **The plugin SDK** (the [sdk/](sdk/) folder: `hailstone_plugin.h`, `hailstone_byte_io.h` and the older
  `nmsc_*.h` names) is under the MIT licence in [sdk/LICENSE](sdk/LICENSE), so a plugin may include it whatever its
  own licence.
- **Third-party code** bundled with or fetched by the build keeps its own licence, listed in
  [THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md).

## The plugin and add-on exception

As a special exception, the copyright holders of Hailstone give you permission to make, use and distribute plugins,
scripts, UI packs and other add-ons for Hailstone under terms of your choice, and to have Hailstone load and run them,
without those add-ons being covered by the GNU General Public License, on condition that the add-on talks to
Hailstone only through:

- the plugin SDK in [sdk/](sdk/) (a compiled plugin built against `hailstone_plugin.h`, using the host functions,
  callbacks, top-level objects and packets it describes), or
- the documented Lua interfaces (the `mq` module, the `eq.*` API and the UI pack files described in
  [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md) and [docs/dev-ui.md](docs/dev-ui.md)).

An add-on that copies code from Hailstone outside [sdk/](sdk/), or is linked with it in any other way, is not
covered by this exception, and the GPL applies to it as usual. This exception does not change what Hailstone
itself is under. If you modify Hailstone, you may extend this exception to your version, but you are not obliged
to; if you do not want to, delete this section from your version.

## Before the GPL

Hailstone was released under the MIT licence up to and including 0.7.0-beta (the repository's history up to the
commit that brought in this file). Those releases and that code remain available under the MIT licence, which
permits including it in this GPL work. Its notice is kept here, as the MIT licence asks:
