"""Writes src/game/shield_models.inc: the item models (IT<n>) that Hailstone
holds on the shield point beyond the original client's list (CDisplay::IsShield
@0x489d70, game::is_shield_model), a deliberate difference behind
display.extra_shields (docs/formats/characters.md "Held items").

RoF2's list stops at the shields of its own time, so it holds about a third of
an EQEmu database's shields in the hand like a weapon (EQEmu client DLLs patch
IsShield with a list of their own for the same reason). A model joins here when
shield items (item type 8) make up more than half of the items using it that are
not augments (type 54: ornaments, which carry the shield's model as well). That
leaves out the placeholder IT63 and the weapon and armour models a few shields
borrow.

Ornaments of later shields often have a model no other item uses (IT13903..13985,
IT100003..100169). The items table does not say which kind of item such an
ornament fits, so with --game-dir a model only augments use joins when its EQG model (it<n>.mod) is shaped like a
shield in every archive that has one. Seen from its broad side, a shield covers
most of the box around it: at least SHIELD_FILL of it, where every shield above
covers 0.45 or more, while the weapon ornaments in the same number ranges (axes,
swords, hammers, a handle with a head) cover 0.42 at most. It must also be no
more than SHIELD_LONG times as long as it is wide and SHIELD_THICK times as
thick (the shields above measure at most 3.0 and 0.43). A model with no EQG
mesh, or none in the folders given, stays out. SEEN_SHIELDS are ornament models
that are shields to the eye but fail the measure: a grip standing off the back
makes them thick, horns or spikes leave the box mostly empty. Every model the
measure lets in was looked at as well (drawn from its broad side). SEEN_SHIELDS
also holds the Haunting and Grim Nightmares Shield Ornaments (IT101064, IT101068):
RoF2 holds them in the hand with the pumpkin face outward, Hailstone wears them on
the forearm like the other shield ornaments (its iron back then faces outward).

The input is the items table of an EQEmu (PEQ) database, one "idfile<TAB>itemtype"
row per item, and the game folders to measure ornament models in (read only):
