# The wiki

Hailstone's [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/projecthailstone/hailstone-client/wiki) is built from this folder. `docs/`
stays the source, so a change to the code and the page that describes it are still one commit (AGENTS.md "Docs travel
with the code"); the wiki is output and is not edited by hand. Each page starts with a comment naming its source file,
and the footer says where to edit.

## What `tools/sync_wiki.py` does

- Writes one page per document in its `PAGES` table, plus `Home` (the index, by section), `_Sidebar` and `_Footer`,
  and copies `docs/images/`.
- Rewrites links for the wiki: a link to a document goes to its page, a link to any other file in the repository goes
  to that file on GitHub. A `docs/<name>.md` mention in text or in backticks becomes a link to its page, and a quoted
  section name right after it (`docs/layout.md "RoF2 or live"`) becomes the link's anchor when that heading exists.
  Code blocks are left as they are.
- Deletes pages it wrote before that it no longer writes (a document renamed or removed). Files it did not write are
  left alone.

A new document needs a line in `PAGES` (its section and page name); `--check` fails until it has one.

## Publishing

The wiki is a git repository of its own beside this one. Its first page has to be made once in the browser (Wiki,
Create the first page) before it can be cloned.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/projecthailstone/hailstone-client.wiki.git ../hailstone-client.wiki
tools/sync_wiki.py --out ../hailstone-client.wiki
cd ../hailstone-client.wiki && git add -A && git commit -m "Sync from hailstone-client <commit>" && git push
```

Sync after a merge to `main` that changes `docs/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `server/README.md`. `tools/sync_wiki.py
--check` writes nothing and exits 1 when a document is not in `PAGES` or a markdown link points at a file that does
not exist. A plain `docs/` mention of a file that is not here is left as text, since it is often another repository's
(a plugin's `docs/nms.md`).
