# Navigation

Code: `src/nav/` (the mesh, its cache, the path follower), `src/app/navigator.{h,cpp}` (the client's side),
`src/mq/nav_commands.cpp` (`/nav`, `/moveto`, `/stick`) and the `Navigation` and `Stick` TLOs in `src/mq/tlo_game.cpp`. Tests:
`tests/nav_test.cpp`, and `fuzz: navigation cache files and their tiles` in `tests/fuzz_assets_test.cpp`.

The original client has no navigation of its own. This is a Hailstone addition for scripted and plugin-driven
characters, in the spirit of MacroQuest's MQ2Nav: it takes MQ2Nav's commands and TLO, not its code (MQ2Nav's
repository has no licence). The meshes are built with Recast/Detour (zlib, `THIRD_PARTY.md`).

## What it drives

Only what a player drives: the heading and the movement keys (forward, strafe, jump), once a frame, where `/follow`
steers (`app/client_app_player.cpp`). Speed, collision, gravity and the position updates the server sees are the
movement rules' own (`docs/mechanics.md`), so a navigating character moves exactly as one under a player's hands.
The heading is set at once, as `/follow`'s FollowPlayerAI sets it (`game/follow.h`). Nothing writes the position.

The player's own forward, back, turn or strafe keys end a walk, as they end `/follow`. Starting a walk ends `/follow`.
Nothing moves while the player cannot (sitting, frozen, dead, `/safelock`); the walk carries on when they can.

## The mesh

Built from the zone's collision triangles (`game::CollisionMesh`): what the movement sweep collides with is what is
rasterised, so there is no separate tool and no hand-made file.

- Passable triangles (WLD polygon flag 0x10, EQG flag 1) are left out; the sweep never hits them. The exception is
  a water surface: a flat passable triangle with water 1.5 under its middle and none 1.5 over it. It is ground for
  the mesh, so a path can cross water whose bottom is too deep or too steep to walk ("Water" below).
- Triangles wholly outside the terrain's box, 200 units round it, are left out. Zones park the objects they do not
  use far under the world (Field of Bone's trees stand at z -32768); taken in, they stretched the heightfield past
  Recast's span heights (8191 cells, about 2457 units) and the whole mesh was built 32000 units under the zone. The
  movement sweep still has them.
- A triangle whose record normal faces up within 55 degrees is ground. A floor stops a fall only when its normal faces
  up (the sweep skips back faces), so a triangle facing down is never ground, only an obstacle.
- Agent: height 6, radius 2, climb 4, cells of 0.6 x 0.3, tiles of 128 cells (76.8 units). These are not the
  original's numbers. The movement sweep's own radius is provisional (`docs/unknowns.md`), so they are
  conservative: a path keeps 2 units from walls, more than the 1.78 sweep radius of a human. The climb is 4, not 3:
  the sweep starts lifted over the feet (DoCollisionMovement's lift), so a player walks up a step a little over 3
  (the walkway into Trakanon's lair in Old Sebilis is one).
- A path's bends keep further off walls where there is room (`PathOptions::wall_clearance`, 2.5 more than the
  mesh's margin by default, `/nav option clearance <0..6>`; Hailstone's own, so a walk does not scrape along walls and
  catch on corners). The search's bends lie on the margin's edge, wrapped round what is inside each turn; each is
  moved out from the turn (the bisector of the way in and out, read from the path as found, so a corner the mesh
  rounds into two bends moves as a whole) by the clearance less its distance to the nearest wall, or half that, and
  kept only where it is still on the mesh, no nearer another wall, and the lines to it and on from it stay on the
  mesh. Not the ends, nor either end of a drop or swim link. A wider margin for the whole mesh would close narrow
  ways and need every zone's mesh built again.
- Areas come from the zone's regions (`assets::ZoneRegions::lookup`, 2 units above each polygon's middle, and 1.5
  under it for a water surface): water, lava and slime, zone lines, PvP. Zone lines are thin, so their volumes
  (their BSP leaves' boxes, or EQG's boxes, 10 higher for the buried ones `game/zone_lines.h` fires from above) are
  also marked into each tile as it is built (`nav::AreaBox`, Recast's box marking): polygons split along their edges
  and none that only overlaps one passes for ground. The search costs water 3, lava 20 (and never crosses it unless allowed), and zone
  lines 1000 (stepping in leaves the zone, so a path crosses one only when there is no other way).
- A Hailstone difference, on by default (`/nav option passdoors on|off`): while `/nav` or `/stick` moves the
  player, a door that is not shut (open, opening or closing) does not block, neither the movement sweep nor the walk's
  look for doors in its way; shut doors still block and are clicked, and the player's own movement always collides
  as the original's does. The client cannot know a door's state on the server: EQEmu shuts most doors after their
  close timer (5 s) without telling the clients, the client shuts its own after its repop time (10 or 20 s), and an
  NPC leaving a waypoint opens the doors near it, told only to players within 200. Clicks to get an open leaf out of
  the way (the ways round, shutting it to give way, keeping out of its swing, below) swung doors the wrong way and
  left walks stuck against them in the Plane of Hate. With the option on, the walk clicks a shut door in its way,
  once more if the answer leaves it as it was (below), and walks on through it while it swings; the ways round, the
  give-way shutting and the swing hold below apply only with the option off.
- Doors are not in the collision mesh, so the mesh runs through every doorway, open or shut. A door ahead is
  clicked early: every 0.2 s the walk sweeps a body-sized sphere along its path, at most 30 units on, and a door
  whose model it hits is clicked as soon as the player is within reach of it (UseSwitch's test,
  `GameConnection::door_in_reach`), without stopping, so it has swung open by the time the walk gets there. Only a
  door at rest closed that blocks movement is clicked early; one that reads open while in the way is left to the
  stall below. Reaching a door clicked early that is still swinging, the walk holds for it as below; one that is
  shut (it never moved, or it has closed again) is clicked once more there.
- An open door's leaf in the way (doors swing into the passage, and the mesh runs through them) is walked round,
  not clicked: when the sweep 6 on hits a door that rests open, the walk looks out to either side (1.5 to 9, the
  nearer first) for a point it can reach clear of the leaf and the zone's walls from which the way on is clear too,
  and goes by it and a point 4 past the leaf before the path's next corner, at most twice per door and walk (each
  way round starts the stall clock again). A door a walk opened is not clicked shut while there may be a way round
  it, for 2 minutes and by later walks too (a script starts walk after walk), since the click would swing it shut in
  the walk's face (The Plane of Hate's HPMDR401 was opened and shut every 15 s this way). Once its ways round have
  failed, or there is none, it is in the way open: a door that swings across the passage being walked, not the one
  walked through (The Plane of Hate's side doors, HPSDR401SM), and it is shut at the stall. No door is clicked more
  than twice in 2 minutes by the walks, so one that blocks the way open and shut is not swung for ever, with one
  exception: a door shut that way which a walk then finds shut in its way (by the stall's sweep, or ahead on the
  path) is the one being walked through, and it is opened again, once, whatever the count and however lately the
  walk clicked it. A Plane of Hate side door's leaf lies across a passage as wide as the door, so from the leaf's
  side the doorway cannot be reached while it stands open; shut, walked up to and opened from in front, its leaf
  swings past the walker (the walk used to stand against it shut until the 2 minutes were up). What the walks did
  with doors is forgotten at a zone load: door ids are the zone's.
- A door a walk clicks (ahead, or at a stall) is kept clear of while it swings: within 14 of its origin (times its
  scale) the walk steps back away from it, at that edge it holds, and it goes on once the door has come to rest
  (moved and open or shut again), has not moved 1.5 s after the click, or 8 s have passed. A leaf swinging into the
  walker traps it: The Plane of Hate's side doors, clicked ahead from 25 or so, caught a walk that went on into the
  doorway while they swung (a walk farther off, or by a door whose origin is far from its doorway, is not held).
- A door clicked at a stall whose answer leaves it as it was (its timestamp moves, its state never does) is clicked
  again, once: the server had it the other way. EQEmu shuts most doors after their close timer (5 s by default,
  `doors.close_timer_ms`) without telling the clients, and the client shows them open until its own repop time (10
  or 20 s), so a click to shut one in between opens it on the server instead. The walk took that for a door that did
  not open and gave up against the leaf (The Plane of Hate's side doors, shut to give way 5 to 10 s after a walk
  opened them).
- A walk that gives up stuck logs what it saw (`nav: stuck at ...`): where it stood, its next corner, and each door
  within 50 (place, heading and closed heading, swing, state, type, scale; whether its model is on the body, whether
  a walk opened it, its recent clicks), and the door the way on runs into. A door clicked ahead of the walk logs how
  far off it was and from where. A door
  reading open that no walk opened, with no way round (a gate, Kedge Keep's), is clicked at the stall, below. Each
  way round is logged with the door and its points.
- A walk that stalls at a door clicks it, then carries on. The door is the one whose model a body-sized sphere 6 units on towards the next
  corner hits (the movement sweep against the doors), clicked whichever way it rests, since some doors stand in
  the way while their state reads open (inverted ones, a gate's other halves: Kedge Keep's KEDGRATE2 and the
  secret door KEDBOX); or else a closed door whose origin is within 15 in front (a door's origin can be well off
  its doorway). A door is not clicked again within 15 s of the walk clicking it (a second click swings it back). The door is tried at the first sign of a stall, before any jumping and strafing, and the walk
  then holds still until the way is clear: the door moved and no door is hit by the same sweep (the next piece of
  a gate in the way is clicked at once; a gate's state can read opening for a while, and it closes again on its
  own), at most 8 s; its
  stuck counts then start again. A door that never moves (locked, a key, a lever elsewhere) is not clicked again on
  that walk, and a walk that then gets stuck says which door did not open. A door whose click teleports cannot
  be told from the RoF2 door record, so `/nav option doors off` turns this off (`docs/unknowns.md`).

### Links: drops and swims

Recast meshes only what is walked, so a ledge, a pool's floor and the water over it are separate parts of the mesh.
Each tile's build joins them with Detour off-mesh links (`find_links` in `nav/nav_mesh.cpp`):

- **Drops.** From every open edge of the mesh, every 5 units, the builder looks 6 (then 3.5) units out: with nothing
  across the way at the knees and the head, the first floor straight down is the landing. A walkable landing more
  than a climb below gets a one-way link, when the fall is within the safe height or it lands in water. The safe
  height is the most the original's fall-damage formula (ApplyFallDamage, `game/mechanics/movement.h`) forgives a
  character carrying nothing, falling from rest at the default gravity: 20 units. Into water the drop can be any
  depth (up to 2000; no fall damage in water: Kedge Keep's way in is a shaft of water some 270 deep), and it is a
  swim (water's cost, left out with water avoided). A drop into water goes both ways when the water comes up to within 5 of the ledge
  (swum back up and climbed out), whether it lands on the surface or on the floor under it.
- **Swims.** A polygon under deep water (water 2 over its middle) whose column of water reaches a water surface
  over it gets a link both ways to that surface, at most one every 15 units. Water's cost (3) applies.
- A swim link between a ledge and the water beside or under it is taken by way of the open column it was found in:
  the path turns at the top (or foot) of the column, straight up or down there, then across. The straight line
  between its ends runs under the ledge, into the floor of the room over the water (seen in Kedge Keep).
- A drop costs twice its length, so a path takes one when it saves the long way round. The walk takes a link as it
  takes any corner: a drop by walking off the edge towards the landing, a swim by the look pitch (steeper, up to 80
  degrees, when the next corner is straight over or under). A walk that starts off the mesh (floating high over the floor: Kedge Keep's arrivals are 26 over theirs) starts from
  the nearest polygon within 100 up or down. A walk that cannot find a new path while it is off the
  mesh (falling, or in a column of water) carries on along the one it has.
- `/nav ui` draws the drops in orange and the swims (and drops that go both ways) in light blue.

Kedge Keep from the arrival to Phinigel Autropos (all under water: down the shaft and through its halls, up and down
between their levels) and Lower Guk from the undead side's entrance to the ghoul lord are walked too: a drop into a flooded room
whose floor is under the water and the swim back up out of it. Seen in Old Sebilis (the real-zones test with `EQ_GAME_DIR`, walked by the movement rules over the zone's collision):
from the zone-in to Trakanon's lair is a drop of 56 into the water, a swim down to the floor under it and up again,
and the step into the lair. Without the links the walk stopped about 850 units short.

### When it is built

At the zone-in only when the zone has a cache file, or with `nav.prebuild=1` in `hailstone.ini`. Otherwise it is built
when first wanted: a `/nav`, the overlay or the Navigation TLO's path questions. The tiles are built on worker threads (`nav.threads`, default 2, at most
8), nearest the player first, and a walk asked for meanwhile starts when its tiles are there. A walk to a spawn asks
the server for its path meanwhile, when there is no mesh under the player yet: the same `OP_FindPersonRequest` as
`/find`, but quiet (`GameConnection::request_quiet_path`: no path drawn, no sound, no chat line). A stock EQEmu server
answers from its own navigation mesh when it has one. The client keeps the requests in flight in order and gives
each reply to the oldest one waiting. EQEmu does not promise that order: it sends an empty reply (no target, no route
or only part of one) at once, but builds a full path on its thread pool and sends it when done, so a quiet request for
a long path and a `/find` that fails just after it can still swap (`docs/unknowns.md`). EQEmu leaves a find of a
trader unanswered (it moves the player to the trader instead), so a request still waiting after 10 s (our own number)
is taken as never answered. A walk that needs a new path while the mesh is unfinished waits
for its tiles (and asks the server again) instead of giving up. A `/nav` word of three letters or more that begins only
one subcommand stands for it (`/nav tar` is `/nav target`). Measured with 4 threads:
qeynos2 0.6 s (720 tiles), befallen 0.07 s, anguish 4.6 s (5440 tiles).

### Cache

`cache/navmesh/<server profile>/<zone>.navmesh` under the data folder (`docs/layout.md`; `default` without a saved
server). Safe to delete. Layout (`nav::encode_cache`):

```
u32 magic "HSNM"   u32 version (4)   u32 native layout (Detour version | sizeof(dtPolyRef) << 16 | little-endian << 24)
u64 geometry hash  u32 build-parameter hash   u64 builder fingerprint
f32 origin x, y, z (Recast axes)   f32 tile size   i32 tiles x, tiles y
u32 tile count, then for each: i32 tx, i32 ty, u32 size, the tile's Detour data
u64 FNV-1a of everything before it
```

The builder fingerprint (`nav::builder_fingerprint`) is a hash of what this build of the client makes of a small fixed
scene with one of each thing the builder makes (`nav::fingerprint_scene`: ground and a step, a drop off a ledge, a
pool's floor joined to its surface, a flooded room dropped into and climbed out of, a zone line's box), and of the
links' numbers. It is worked out once, at the first zone load, in a few milliseconds. A file written by a builder
that makes anything else of that scene (its rules, Recast, the compiler) is built again on its own, with no version
to raise by hand; a test checks the scene still has each kind, so a new kind of link should be added to it.

The fields are little-endian (`core/byte_io.h`). The tile data is Detour's own in-memory layout, so a file is read
back only by a build with the same native layout. Reading Detour's structs straight out of those bytes (the tile
checks in `nav_mesh.cpp`) is the one accepted exception to the rule that wire and file data go through `ByteReader`:
Detour takes a tile only in that layout, and the file is this client's own cache, guarded by the native-layout word
and the checksum. A file whose hashes or grid do not match the zone's geometry and
the build's parameters, or whose checksum fails, is ignored and built again. Each tile is then checked before Detour
sees it (`NavMesh::add_tile`): its size against the counts in its header, every polygon's vertex, neighbour and
detail indices, a boundary edge in each polygon's detail mesh, coordinates finite and within the world, and the
bounding-volume tree's indices.

## Floors over floors

Recast's mesh has every level of a building, a hall and the balcony over it, so a goal's height matters:

- Where the goal stands is the polygon round it (4 across, 12 up or down) that is nearest with height counted four
  times as much as distance across, so the floor under a spawn wins over the one under that, or over it.
- When that polygon cannot be reached from the start, Detour's own fallback would stop at the polygon nearest in a
  straight line, which in a building is usually the floor right under the goal. Instead the polygons within 32 across
  and 64 up or down are tried, best first by the same measure, and the first one a walk can reach (the mesh's links
  flooded from the start) is the end: the near edge of the goal's own floor rather than the hall under it, when there
  is one.
- A corner, or the end, counts as reached within 2 across (the end: the walk's distance) and within 8 in height, so
  standing under a corner of a ramp that winds back over itself, or under the goal, is not being there. The server's
  path (`/find`'s) is at its own mesh's heights and is reached by distance across alone.
- A walk that still ends more than 8 over or under the goal says "Stopped 12 below ...: the mesh has no way up there"
  (a lift, a jump or a drop it does not know).

## Zone lines on the way

A walk never steps into a zone line by accident: when the step ahead (3 units on, a body's middle up) is in a zone
line's region, the walk stops with "Stopped at a zone line on the way to ...", unless zone lines are allowed
(`/nav option zonelines on`) or the goal itself is in one. Seen live: the border of Oasis of Marr and North Ro.

## Water

The mesh has the water surfaces (above) as well as the bottoms, marked Water; the search pays 3 for them, or never
crosses them with `/nav option water off`. Forward swims along the look pitch (the physics' push along the pitch),
so while swimming (BodyWet 5 and up) the walk sets the pitch each frame, towards the path's next corner
(`Navigator::swim_pitch`; /follow does the same towards its path or the spawn):

- the head under water and the air below 35% of the most: straight up, whatever the corner;
- a corner out of the water within 12: up, so forward rises and the original's swim jump (DoSwimJump: forward with
  the pitch up and the surface ahead clear) climbs out onto the shore;
- at the surface (the head out, or no water a little over the head: it cannot rise further) and the way ahead no
  deeper: level, so forward goes across instead of pushing up against the surface for nothing;
- otherwise towards the point 4 units on along the path at the path's height there (`PathFollower::ahead`), at
  most 63 degrees (80 when the next corner is straight over or under: a swim link): diving to a corner below,
  rising to one above. Aiming along the path, not straight at its next corner, keeps the swim at the path's height:
  a path along a pool's floor runs through openings only a little taller than a body, and a straight line at the
  corner from higher up runs into their tops (seen in Old Sebilis at the real frame rate).

These numbers are ours. Out of the water the pitch is left alone.

## /follow

A Hailstone change to the original's /follow (`game/follow.h`, FollowPlayerAI), on by default and switchable:
`hailstone.ini` `nav.follow=0`, or `/nav option follow off`. The original turns only while it has a clear line to the
followed spawn and runs straight at it, so a corner, a doorway or a wall loses it, and it gives up past 200.

- While the spawn is in a clear line that the mesh can walk straight, the original's step steers, exactly as it does.
- Otherwise (out of sight, or a drop or an obstacle on the straight line), the walk takes the mesh's path to where
  the spawn stands, re-planned as it moves (every 0.5 s once it has moved 3), with the walk's own unsticking. The
  original's bands still decide stopping, walking and running, measured along the path: stop inside 15 + both
  heights, walk inside 30 + both heights when the spawn is slower.
- The follow keeps on to 400 away (the original stops at 200, with its "too far" message, which still ends it past
  400 or when the spawn dies).
- The help's own strafes do not end the follow (the original's turn and strafe keys still do, when the player
  presses them). If the help gets stuck it hands back to the original's step for 5 s, then tries again.
- Off the mesh (levitating, swimming, a ledge it left out) the original's step steers alone. `/nav ui` draws the
  follow's path in cyan.
- A `/nav` walk and /follow do not run together: either one started ends the other.

## Getting unstuck

A walk that stops getting closer to its next corner for 1 s jumps and strafes for 0.6 s, one side and then the other.
Those times count only up to 0.25 s of any one frame: a hitch (a zone or a model loading) is not time the character
had to move in, so it is neither a stall nor part of a jump and strafe.
A strafe is held back (the walk only jumps) when the floor 4 to either side is more than 5 under the feet, so it
never steps off a walkway over a pit (seen in Lower Guk with a body wider than the mesh's agent).
After three of those it finds a new path from where it stands, or first clicks a closed door in the way. After three
new paths with no corner reached it stops with "Navigation stuck going to ...".

## Commands

`/nav` (MQ2Nav's set; the 'move' permission for plugins and scripts, `plugin/policy.h`):

| Command | |
|---|---|
| `/nav id <#>` / `target` / `spawn <search>` | to a spawn (MQ's search words, `docs/plugins.md`), following it as it moves; done within 5 |
| `/nav loc <y> <x> <z>` (`locyxz`) / `locxyz <x> <y> <z>` / `locyx <y> <x>` | to a point (`/loc` order, or x y z); done within 2 |
| `/nav door <name> [click]` / `door id <#> [click]` | to the nearest door whose name contains the text; `click` uses it on arrival |
| `distance=<n>` (`dist=<n>`) | anywhere on the line: stop this close |
| `/nav stop` / `pause` | stop; pause or go on |
| `/nav status` | the mesh's tiles and the walk |
| `/nav ui` (`overlay`) | the mesh (green ground, blue water, red lava, purple zone lines, yellow PvP), its links (orange drops, light blue swims) and the path, over the 3D view |
| `/nav reload` (`rebuild`) | build the zone's mesh again, ignoring the cache |
| `/nav option water\|lava\|pvp\|zonelines\|doors\|passdoors\|follow on\|off` | swim (on), cross lava (off), enter PvP areas (on), walk through zone lines (off), open doors (on), walk through doors that are not shut (on), help /follow (on) |
| `/nav option clearance <0..6>` | how much further than the mesh's margin a path's bends keep from walls (2.5; 0: hug the margin) |

Not yet: `/nav item`, waypoints (`/nav waypoint`, `/nav recordwaypoint`).

`/moveto` (MQ2MoveUtils' straight walk, no mesh): `/moveto loc <y> <x> [z]` (or `y,x`), `/moveto id [#]` (the target
without a number), `/moveto mdist <n>` (where it stops, default 10), `/moveto off`.

`/stick` (MQ2MoveUtils' words; Hailstone's own walk, `NavControl::stick`): keeps to the target until `/stick off`, the
player's own movement keys, or the spawn dying or leaving. Further than the distance it walks: straight when the spot
is within 40, in plain sight and the straight line stays on the mesh until it is within that distance of the spot,
over the mesh otherwise (straight without a mesh, or off it), the path found again as the spawn moves. Sight at the
body's middle alone lets a wall's corner catch the body; the mesh keeps its margin from walls, and a mob against a
wall stands in that margin itself, hence "within that distance". Near enough it holds still and faces the spawn. `/stick [<distance>] [behind] [id <#>]`: the distance is flat,
by default three quarters of the player's melee range of the spawn (the original's `__get_melee_range`; the quarter
keeps the player in reach while the spawn shifts and its position updates lag: Hailstone's choice); `behind` stands
at its back, within 45 degrees. It keeps to the spawn it was given, whatever is targeted later (MQ2MoveUtils'
`hold`); `/stick` again moves it to the new target. A `/nav` or `/moveto` walk ends a stick, and a stick ends a walk.
Not yet: MQ2MoveUtils' `pin`, `!front`, `moveback`, `uw` and percent distances.

`${Stick}` (ON / OFF), `.Active`, `.Status` (ON, PAUSED, OFF), `.Distance`, `.StickTarget` (the spawn's id, 0 none),
`.StickTargetName`.

### The Navigation TLO

`${Navigation}` (TRUE while walking), `.Active`, `.Paused`, `.MeshLoaded`, `.PathExists[<dest>]`,
`.PathLength[<dest>]` (-1 without a path). Hailstone's own: `.MeshComplete`, `.TilesBuilt`, `.TilesTotal`,
`.Destination`, `.Remaining`. A destination is `id <#>`, `target`, `loc <y> <x> <z>` (`locyxz`), `locxyz <x> <y> <z>` or a spawn
search. Lua reads it as `mq.TLO.Navigation.Active()`; plugins with the SDK's `parse` and run `/nav` with
`do_command`.

## Not done

- Swimming is not yet seen live end to end (unit tests only; the live try was cut short by an attack). Levitation
  and boats are not handled.
- Lifts, and jumps up onto ledges, as links between parts of the mesh; walks across zones (`/travel`); tactical queries (a spot
  in range with line of sight, behind a mob); a mesh editor and waypoints; several characters in one process.
