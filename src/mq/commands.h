// MacroQuest's own commands and its command-line handling, on the hook bus (plugin/hooks.h):
//  - every line, typed or run by a script or plugin, has its ${...} replaced (mq/parse.h) unless it is /noparse or
//    the client's own windows send it (LiteralLine);
//  - a line a plugin or script runs is checked against its capabilities (plugin/policy.h caller_caps) and refused
//    with a chat line when the server did not grant them, and checked again as it finally is, after every other line
//    filter (a plugin's command rewrite) has had it;
//  - /echo, /target (id, clear, mycorpse, or a spawn search), /face, /keypress, /squelch, /docommand, /noparse;
//  - /nav and /moveto on the client's navigation (mq/nav_commands.h).
// The rest of MQ's commands come from the script host (/lua) and the plugin manager (/plugin).
