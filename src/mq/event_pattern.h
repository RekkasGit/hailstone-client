// An mq.event pattern, matched as MacroQuest matches it: MQ's Lua events feed each chat line to Blech (Lax/Blech
// 1.7.4, contrib/Blech/Blech.h, with '#' the scan and '|' the print delimiter; plugins/lua/LuaEvent.cpp), read as
// the spec, not copied.
//
//  - #name# takes text from the line: #*#, #1#, #2#, ... or any other name (#target#). Only a whole number above 0
//    is handed to the script; the others match and are dropped. A '#' with no closing one makes the rest of the
//    pattern a name, so it takes the rest of the line.
//  - |text| is the text's ${...} parsed when a line comes (MQ's LuaVarProcess); outside it, `##` is a literal '#'
//    and `||` a literal '|'.
//  - The rest is literal, matched ignoring the case of A-Z.
//  - A literal before the first #...# must start the line; with no #...# at all the line must be the pattern.
//    Each #...# takes text up to the first place the literal after it is found (none: up to where the next #...#
//    starts, so the first of two adjacent ones gets ""). The last one takes the rest of the line; the literal after
//    it must be found first at the very end. So #*# takes as little as the line allows too: "#*# says #1#" on
//    "A says B says C" gives #1# "B says C".
//  - A line break is a character like any other, and an empty line matches nothing.
//
// One deliberate difference: Blech keeps all of a script's events in one tree of shared prefixes and walks it once
// per line; where two patterns share a literal's beginning, the walk can turn down a line that pattern alone would
// match. Here each pattern is matched on its own, as its text says.
//
// A #n# above kMaxArg is not handed on (a deliberate difference: MQ makes a table of n arguments, and #2000000000#
// runs it out of memory).
//
// A match is one pass over the pattern: a string search for each literal in what is left of the line, never trying
// another place for an earlier one (no backtracking, so no regex blowup on a line built to be slow).
