// Client side of the SOE ("daybreak") UDP session protocol used by the login,
// world and zone servers. Contract shared by the net and app code; the
// implementation is in session.cpp.
//
// Threading: like the original's UdpManagerThread (UdpLibrary in eqgame.exe,
// started by NetMgr_CreateUdpManager; docs/protocol/session.md), a service thread receives,
// acknowledges, resends and flushes every 20 ms, so a long frame (zone
// loading) does not stall the session. The public functions may be called from
// one owner thread; update() services the session as well and is cheap. The
// trace callback runs on either thread, under the session's lock.
