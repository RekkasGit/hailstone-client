// Keeps a server profile's folder in step with the server's client_files/ (net/server_files_packets.h,
// docs/layout.md "Server files"). The server's client_files/ holds its hailstone.cfg (plugin/policy.h), the files it
// produces (spells_us.txt, Resources/SkillCaps.txt ...), and assets/, plugins/ and scripts/; they land in
// servers/<profile>/ as hailstone.cfg, assets/ (client_files/assets/ and every other file), plugins/ and scripts/
// (server_file_destination). At the first zone-in of a login the connection holds the zone-in (it neither asks for
// the zone's spawns nor loads the zone) while this:
//   1. asks the zone for the server's list of files (path, size, SHA-256);
//   2. compares it with the profile's folder: a file is current when its size and hash match. What this put there
//      is recorded in servers/<profile>/server_files.txt, so its files are not hashed again;
//   3. downloads the others, a piece at a time with several pieces asked ahead, into servers/<profile>/.download/,
//      and checks each one's hash. A file already there and complete (an earlier, broken-off download) is kept;
//   4. once all have come, moves them into place and deletes the files it put there earlier that the server no
//      longer lists. Files the player added by hand that the server does not list stay.
// Nothing changes until every file has come, so a failed or broken-off download leaves the old files.
// A server without Hailstone's script does not answer, and after kListTimeout the zone-in goes on as it was (after
// kKnownListTimeout for a server that sent its files before: its zone may be hashing new files).
// Paths are checked (core rules in is_safe_server_file_path); programs are refused, except Lua in scripts/ and in a
// plugin's ui/, and this platform's libraries in plugins/.
