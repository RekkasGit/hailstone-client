// The zone's fires, found in its data for the modern lighting's procedural flames (render/fire_renderer.h,
// docs/graphics.md "Fire"). The original draws a flame one of three ways, by the zone's era:
//   - a flame mesh on a placed object or door: crossed quads with an animated additive texture (FIRE1_MDF's
//     fire1..4.bmp and its blue, green, red and violet kin), the old world's and Velious's torches, lamps,
//     braziers and campfires;
//   - a particle cloud on a placed object's skeleton node (0x34, Zone::particle_fixtures), Luclin onwards: flame
//     sprites GENG*.DDS / GENPOP*.DDS, usually with a smoke cloud beside them;
//   - an EQG zone's environment emitters (<zone>_EnvironmentEmitters.txt over environmentemittersnew.edd): the
//     same kind of cloud at a point, flame sprites FlameD.dds, new_flame.dds, new_fire.dds and the like.
// What is not a flame though it is named like one stays: the logs, coals and holders (FIREWOOD, COALS, TORCHTOP),
// the fireplaces' stones, Takish's red crystal torches (TAKTORCH01), YKFLAME01 (black: its flame is the cloud on
// it) and the smoke.
