// Walking a path the way a player would: each step gives the heading to face and the movement keys to hold, never a
// position. The character still moves by the client's own movement rules (game/mechanics: speed, collision,
// gravity), so a navigating character moves exactly as fast and as far as one under a player's hands, and the
// server sees ordinary movement. The heading is set at once, as /follow's FollowPlayerAI sets it (game/follow.h).
//
// Getting unstuck: when the distance to the next corner stops shrinking, the follower jumps and strafes, one side
// then the other; when that does not help it asks for a new path (NeedsPath), and after a few new paths with no
// corner reached it gives up (Failed) rather than running into a wall for ever.
