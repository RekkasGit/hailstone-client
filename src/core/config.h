// Small key=value settings file. Lines starting with '#' or ';' are comments;
// keys keep their insertion order when saved. Values are stored as text.
// Two clients may run at once with the same hailstone.ini: when the file changed on disk since this Config read or
// wrote it, save() keeps the other program's keys and writes only the keys set or erased here over them.
//
// Hailstone: a character's own settings. While a character layer is attached (attach_character()), every key but the
// shared ones (is_shared_key: the asset folder, add-ons, updates, the login, the window ...) is read from and written
// to the character's file, never hailstone.ini; the file starts as a copy of hailstone.ini's keys the first time the
// character enters. So clients run at once can each play with settings of their own (a lower render scale on a
// second character's client, say).
