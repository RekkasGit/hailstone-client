// Minimal zip reader (the updater's packages, docs/updater.md): the central directory is read once, and each entry is
// streamed out a piece at a time, so an archive of a few hundred MB is never held in memory. Stored and deflated
// entries only; no zip64 and no encryption, which the release script never makes. The archive comes from a download,
// so nothing in it is trusted: every offset and length is checked against the archive's size, a name that could
// leave the folder it is extracted into refuses the whole archive, and an entry is cut off as soon as it would
// inflate past its declared size (a zip bomb) and checked against its CRC-32 at the end.
