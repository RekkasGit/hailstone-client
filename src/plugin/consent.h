// The player's word on a server's compiled plugins (docs/plugins.md "The server's compiled plugins ask first"). A
// library the server sent (servers/<profile>/plugins/) runs as native code with the player's full rights, so it
// loads only once the player allowed those exact bytes for that server: the answers are kept by SHA-256 in
// servers/<profile>/plugin_approvals.txt, which the server's files cannot reach (net::server_file_destination writes
// only hailstone.cfg, scripts/, plugins/ and assets/ there). A plugin whose bytes change asks again.
