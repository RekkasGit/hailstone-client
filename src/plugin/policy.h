// What a server lets compiled plugins and MacroQuest Lua scripts do, from the hailstone.cfg in its client_files/
// (docs/plugins.md). A server without one sets no rules: everything runs with every capability. A server with one
// always runs its own plugins and scripts (those it sent into servers/<profile>/plugins and scripts, named by their
// SHA-256), with every capability; the player's own run only when the file allows them, with the capabilities it
// grants. The player's own typed commands are never limited; the capabilities check what plugins and scripts do on
// the player's behalf.
