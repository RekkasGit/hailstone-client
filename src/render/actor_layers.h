// A character's two bone groups (game/anim_layers.h) as the renderer plays
// them: each group is a CBoneGroup, a pair of animation tracks that
// cross-fade (CBoneGroup::BlendToAnimation @0x1003fcc0: the new track's weight
// 0 -> 1 and the old one's 1 -> 0, linear over the blend time; asked for the
// animation it already plays, it does nothing), and ActorLayers decides each
// frame what each group plays: the movement (or rider, or corpse) clip on
// both, an OP_Animation action on both or on the upper body alone.
