// Shadows from the zone's own lights (lights.wld) for the modern lighting (docs/graphics.md, "Light shadows"): the
// lights that matter most near the camera each get a cube of six depth faces in the point shadow map
// (VkContext::begin_point_shadow), holding each caster's distance from the light over the light's radius.
//
// The zone's lights and geometry stay put, so each light's cube of the zone is drawn once, when the light gets its
// slot (the cache, one a frame), and kept. When characters stand in a light's reach its cache is copied into the
// slot's live cube each frame and they are drawn over it.
//
// The lights that move (the one the player carries, the spells' brightest) have slots of their own, kept out of the
// zone lights' share (dynamic_shadow_slots). They have no cache: each frame their live cube is drawn whole, the zone
// round them and the characters, but the bodies they sit inside (set_dynamic). The shaders find them, as every
// shadowed light, by position, so set_dynamic takes them exactly as the scene's light list has them.
//
// A face is this client's mapping, the same in the shaders that draw and read it (shaders/lighting.glsl
// point_shadow_face): faces 0..5 look along +x, -x, +y, -y, +z, -z; the face's two other axes, in order, divided by
// the distance along its own, scaled by kPointShadowFaceScale, are its x and y.
