// The original's mouse look: which button press turns it on, what the release does, and whether the click under
// the cursor still happens. __ProcessMouseEvents @0x539e60 sends a world press or release (one the windows did not
// take, or any while mouse look is on) to CEverQuest::RMouseDown @0x518910 / RMouseUp @0x537d30 and, for the left
// button, MouseLookEngage @0x518870 / CEverQuest::LMouseUp @0x5384d0. ProcessMouseInput @0x5f9e30 swaps the two
// buttons first unless MouseRightHanded (0xddf744) is set. The Options window's Mouse page (MousePageWndNotification
// @0x703a30) sets the options these read.
