// The two bone groups a character actor animates (ActorClient +0x174 /
// +0x170, the actor's GetBoneGroup(0) / GetBoneGroup(1)), and which of them
// an animation plays on.
//
// The actor's bones are split once, when its animations are set up
// (0x4090f0 for classic skeletons, 0x409260 for new-style ones; the
// actor's HasNewStyleHierarchicalModel, vtable +0xbc, picks one): each bone's
// tag goes to a callback through EnumerateBones (CHierarchicalActor, vtable
// +0x194 @0x10040f80) and the bone joins the group it answers. Group 0 holds
// the chest, neck, head and arms (the upper body), group 1 the rest (root,
// pelvis, legs, and the points the callback does not name). Each group is a
// CBoneGroup with its own two-track cross-fade (BlendToAnimation
// @0x1003fcc0), so an action can play over the arms while the legs keep
// walking.
//
// Which group plays what:
//  - classic models (0x4b15b0): the animation asked ("target") goes to
//    group 0 and the "queued" one to group 1; they are the same animation
//    unless a mounted rider's own animation is queued (the legs sit, the arms
//    act), or a moving humanoid starts an action of the table at 0xdced38
//    (the legs keep moving). While an action of that table plays on group 0
//    and has not finished, a walk or run (table 0xdced88) asked for a
//    humanoid starts on group 1 only; other requests wait.
//  - new-style models (0x58afa0): a sequence of layer kind 1 (attacks,
//    casting) plays on group 0 alone while group 1 plays a kind 2 sequence
//    (walk, run, turn) or the player is mounted; otherwise on both groups,
//    each group taking it by 0x58ac90's mode (new_style_layer_mode).
