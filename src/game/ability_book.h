// The Ability Book (Hailstone's own window, not in the original; ui/<name>/abilitybook.lua): every ability the
// player can activate apart from spells, in one list. Three kinds, each used through the stock path its own window
// uses, so the game's and the server's rules hold:
//   - activated alternate abilities (game/alt_adv.h): the AA window's hot button (a social of number 120 + the
//     ability's group, which DoHotButton runs as /alt activate);
//   - combat abilities (disciplines): the combat ability hot button (0x84 + the profile index, doCombatAbility);
//   - activated skills (game/mechanics/abilities.h usable_skills): the skill hot button (UseSkill).
//
// Autoskill is the client's own helper: while it is on, the abilities on its list are used in their order as they
// come ready, one at a time, by default while the player fights (auto attack on an NPC in melee range). A
// beneficial ability may instead be used at any time or only out of combat, and one that leaves a buff can wait
// until the buff has worn off. It uses the same hot button path as a key press and is held to a minimum gap
// between uses. A server's hailstone.cfg can turn it off
// ([abilities] autoskill = off, plugin/policy.h).
//
// This header is the part without the connection: the keys, the skill descriptions and Autoskill's choice.
