// The original's target keys: TOGGLETARGET (Tab), TARGETPC / TARGETNPC /
// TARGETCORPSE and their CYCLE commands (__ExecuteCmd @0x4d7230 cases 26..30
// and 38), with CTargetManager's cycle lists
// (TargetManager_GetNextCycleTarget @0x5c6710 and its helpers).
//
// Follows the original's cycle functions and
// TargetManager_CycleCandidateCallback; the command
// arguments are read from the disassembly at 0x4d8a2f..0x4d8c65:
//   TARGETPC 30 (mode 0, restart), CYCLEPCTARGETS 31 (0), TARGETNPC 32 (1,
//   restart), CYCLENPCTARGETS 33 (1), TARGETCORPSE 34 (2, restart),
//   CYCLECORPSETARGETS 35 (2), range 500 for all.
// Not modelled (the scene graph lives in EQGraphicsDX9.dll, vtable +0x98): the
// distance it measures. The client offers the spawns within 500 units of the
// eye point, in id order, with their 3D distance, that eqgame's filter
// 0x5c58c0 passes (never the local or the controlled player): mode 0 the
// players and the mount races with a rider (whom the candidate callback puts
// in their place), 1 the NPCs that are not mount races and carry no rider,
// 2 the corpses; for modes 0 and 1 it also leaves out the spawns the local
// player's PlayerZoneClient::IsInvisible @0x5a1850 hides (0x5c5a04), of which
// the client models Hide Traders and Hide Buyers (TargetManager::invisible).
// Its other tests (body types, owners, stale updates) are not modelled.
