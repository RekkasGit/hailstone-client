// Hailstone: the bank as last seen. EQEmu's Inventory:LazyLoadBank rule (on by default) leaves the bank and shared
// bank out of OP_CharInventory and sends them, slot by slot, only once per zone and only when a banker comes near
// (Client::Process, Mob::IsCloseToBanker), so at most zone-ins the client does not know what is in the bank. The
// Advanced Inventory and eq.FindItems list this copy then, marked as last seen; it is kept apart from the live
// inventory so that nothing that moves, uses, counts or lore-checks items ever sees it. Saved per character in
// bank.dat (docs/layout.md). Not the original's: the original client keeps no copy of the bank.
