// Riding: how a rider and its mount are linked and unlinked (EQPlayer::GetMount +0x154 / PlayerBase_GetRider
// +0x158 as Spawn::mount_id / rider_id), as the original does it (do_stand @0x593f20, the dismount @0x590510 (vtable +0x60, misnamed SlideIceFriction),
// PlayerClient::ClearVehicleMountLinks @0x5a0400, EQPlayer::do_change_form's re-seat @0x597110..0x5974d2).
//
// There is no mount packet: a mount is an NPC named "<rider>`s_Mount00" of a mount race (EQEmu's Horse, summoned by
// SPA 113), and each client links the two by name when either spawn's actor is made (MakeRiderMountUp: EQPlayer's
// constructor, CEverQuest::CreateInitialActors, do_change_form) or on the buff tick (ProcessAffects' SPA 113 case).
// The local player that mounts a mount race hands its controls to the mount (pinstControlledPlayer,
// WorldState::controlled_id): the mount is moved, and the rider sits on it.
