// Bug reports saved for the player to post (the Discord bug report forum): bug-reports/hailstone-bug-<date>.zip from
// the bug report window (/bugreport) and bug-reports/hailstone-crash-<date>.zip, made on the start after a crash
// from the crash handler's logs/crash-<date>.txt (platform/crash_log.h). Each holds report.txt (the player's words,
// the build, the system, the character and where it stood), summary.md (a forum post to paste), the crash report,
// the logs, hailstone.ini and the screenshots (the one taken when the window opened, then the player's own from the
// minutes before), cut to fit Discord's upload limit: what did not fit is named in report.txt. Every text in it
// has the player's account names and home folder taken out (redact_private()), and the logs the words of every chat
// line (redact_chat(): tells, guild and group chat), since the report is posted in public.
