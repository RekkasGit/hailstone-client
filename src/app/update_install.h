// Installing a staged update into the Hailstone folder, and taking it back out (docs/updater.md). Everything lives
// in <install>/update/:
//   download/<package>.zip  the packages app/updater.h downloaded (each checked by size and SHA-256)
//   ready.txt               the staged update: its version, then each package's component, size, hash and file
//   installed.txt           what the updates put in: each component's package hash and its files, so the next
//                           update removes the files a component no longer ships and skips unchanged components
//   new/                    the packages unpacked, before anything in the folder is touched
//   previous/               the files the last install replaced or removed, until the new version has started
//   journal.txt             the install's moves, one a line, so a cut-off install or a failed start is undone
//   state.txt               "installing <new> <old>" while files move; "pending <new> <old> <starts>" until the
//                           new version reaches the login screen
//   failed.txt              a release that failed to start twice and was rolled back (not offered again)
//   note.txt                what a rollback has to tell the version it starts (StartNote::message)
// The install runs when the client quits (nothing else of it is running then): each file is first unpacked into
// new/, then the old one is moved into previous/ and the new one moved into its place. Both are renames on one
// volume, which Windows allows for a running program and its loaded libraries, so the quitting client can do it
// itself. The player's own files (settings, servers, logs, maps, scripts ...: kPlayerPaths) are never written.
