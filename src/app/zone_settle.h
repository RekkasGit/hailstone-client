// The loading screen's last stretch after a zone-in. The original loads everything it shows before it leaves the
// loading screen (ProcessGame's zone-in runs to "Initialization complete." with the zone, its actors and the UI built),
// so nothing appears afterwards. This client builds some of it as the
// world is first drawn: the characters' appearances (built on render::ActorRenderer's worker, put up within its build
// budget), the light shadows' cubes one a frame (render::kPointShadowBuildsPerFrame), the UI pack's windows on their
// first frame. So once the network's zone-in is done (OP_ClientReady sent) the game runs and draws as usual behind the
// loading screen until those are done, for at least kMinFrames frames and at most kTimeout seconds (a model or texture
// that never comes cannot keep the player out). The connection is polled every frame meanwhile, as always.
