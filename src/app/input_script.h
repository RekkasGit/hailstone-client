// --input-script: a test driver that plays made-up input at set times after zoning in, as the OS and a pad would send
// it (platform::Window's virtual pad and pushed events), so the gamepad modes, the windows' focus and typing can be
// checked headlessly. Steps are ';'-separated "<seconds> <action> [args]", the seconds after the latest zone-in; a
// time written "c<seconds>" counts from when the character select screen last appeared (after a camp, say), one written
// "d<seconds>" from when the disconnected screen (a link death) appeared. Steps run in the order written where the
// clock changes, and by time within a run of steps on the same clock:
//   pad <button> [hold]        a virtual Xbox pad's button (a b x y back guide start ls rs lb rb up down left right),
//                              held `hold` seconds (0.15)
//   axis <lx|ly|rx|ry|lt|rt> <value> [hold]   a stick or trigger at value (-1..1) for `hold` seconds (0.5)
//   key <name> [hold]          a key by its SDL scancode name ("Return", "A", "Escape", "Slash"; "Left_Alt" for "Left Alt")
//   text <text...>             typed text (the text input event)
//   click <x> <y> [right] [hold]   a mouse click at that fraction of the window (0..1), held `hold` seconds (0.08;
//                              "click x y 0.6" a left one)
//   wheel <x> <y> <steps>      the mouse wheel turned there (steps > 0: away from the user)
//   move <x> <y>               the mouse moved there (a hover; a click right after a move lands as a user's would)
//   press <x> <y> / release <x> <y>   the left button down / up there (with moves between: a drag)
//   shot <file>                a screenshot
//   state                      logs the pad's mode and ImGui's focus (ImGuiLayer::debug_state)
//   close                      the window manager's close request (the title bar's X, Alt+F4)
//   droplink                   the world and zone links go silent (net::Session::simulate_link_loss): a link death
// The virtual pad is attached at the start, so it is the pad in use.
