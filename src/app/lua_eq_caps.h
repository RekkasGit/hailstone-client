// What a plugin's code in the UI needs to call each `eq` function (docs/plugins.md "What plugin windows may do"). The
// pack's own code acts as the player and calls them all. A plugin's code (ui::lua::LuaUi::caller_tag, under its
// plugin::CallerScope) calls a function that acts in the game (clicks a stock window's buttons, moves items, casts,
// trains, sends a packet) only with the capability it names: refused, it does nothing and returns nil. Reading and
// drawing need none. Every function is listed (tests/plugin_ui_sandbox_test.cpp checks), and one that is not is
// taken to act (kCapActions).
